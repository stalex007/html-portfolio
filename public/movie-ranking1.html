<h1>The Best Movies According to stalex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Travolta returned, Tarantino ascended and Samuel L. Jackson has been strenghten in faith.<br />
<i>"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing."</i></p>

<h3>Adventures of Ford Fairlane</h3>
<p>This is the king of the cult movies, with the best quotes ever.<br />
<i>"Hey, look. I'm sorry I made you clean the toilets and the bathtubs, I mean, who did all the work in bed?"</i></p>
